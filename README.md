# Investigate-a-Dataset-FBI-Gun-Data
Jupyetr Notebook going through the entire data analysis process for FBI Gun Registration Data and US Census Data

Introduction

The directing questions for this investigation will be as follows:

    What census data is most associated with high gun per capita?

    Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations, and which ?

    What is the overall trend of gun purchases?

    In states with the highest percentage of gun registration, what is the racial demographic breakdown?

    Does the percentage of college educated individuals in a given state impact the percentage of gun registrations?

    For this explatory data analysis, I have elected to analyze US Census Data alongside FBI Gun Data which tracks the number of gun registrations by state from 1968-2017. In analyzing this data, I will aim to answer the above questions while also tracking all of the steps in data wrangling, data cleaning, and exploratory analysis. This analysis we rely on the use of statistical analysis and visualizations to derive insights from these datasets.
